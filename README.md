# 🥦 Smart Food Inventory & Redistribution Platform

Welcome to our **Smart Food Inventory & Redistribution Platform** – a prototype designed to tackle food waste by enabling individuals and businesses to:

- Track food inventory
- Receive expiry alerts
- Donate surplus food to those in need

---

## 🎯 Key Features & Walkthrough

### 1️⃣ Add Food Items
Users can enter food details such as:
- **Name**
- **Quantity**
- **Expiry Date**

This allows for efficient tracking of perishable items.

🖥️ **Demo**: Add a food item and watch it appear in the inventory list.

---

### 2️⃣ Donate Food
When a user decides to donate an item, they simply click the **Donate** button, which transfers it to the donation list.

🖥️ **Demo**: Click "Donate" and see the item move to the donations section.

---

### 3️⃣ Expiry Alerts
To ensure food safety:
- Items nearing expiry are highlighted
- **Expired items are shown in red**, making them easy to identify and avoid

🖥️ **Demo**: Observe an expired item turning red in the inventory.

---

### 4️⃣ Claim Donations
NGOs or individuals in need can:
- Browse the donated items
- **Claim** them with one click

Claimed items are automatically removed from the system.

🖥️ **Demo**: Click "Claim" on a donation and see it disappear from the list.

---

### 5️⃣ Persistent Data with LocalStorage
All data is stored using **LocalStorage**, ensuring that food inventory and donations remain saved even after refreshing the page.

🖥️ **Demo**: Refresh the page — the data is still there!

---

## 💾 Why LocalStorage?
We used **LocalStorage** for the prototype because:
- It's simple and efficient for early-stage development
- No backend setup required

🛠️ In a production-ready version, we can easily integrate a real-time database like **Firebase** or **MySQL**.

---

## ✅ Conclusion
This prototype is a **simple yet powerful** tool to:
- Track food inventory
- Prevent food waste
- Facilitate donations to those in need

With further development, it has the potential to become a **scalable, impactful solution** in the fight against food waste.
